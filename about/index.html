  <h1>Aloha!</h1>
  <p>My name's Desiree. I'm a full stack software developer in Seattle, driven to learn more each day, excited about meeting new challenges, and passionate about blending logic and creativity to solve problems and build awesome products.</p>

  <p>Currently, I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Nordstrom  and a student at Ada Developers Academy, a highly selective (< 10% acceptance rate) and intensive year-long software development training program. Prior to my career transition, my background in Biopsychology provided me with a strong foundation for developing my analytical, organizational, and communication skills.</p>
